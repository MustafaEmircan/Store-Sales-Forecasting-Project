Store Sales Forecasting Project: A Deep Dive into Retail Analytics

I'm thrilled to share the insights and outcomes of our recent project, focused on forecasting store sales for Rossmann, a major retail chain with hundreds of branches. Our objective was to develop an accurate sales forecasting model that could optimize inventory management and enhance customer satisfaction across all stores.

Key Steps in the Project

1.🔍 Problem Identification:
•Rossmann’s challenge was to optimize inventory management by accurately forecasting sales, which would reduce excess stock and minimize stock shortages across its stores.

2.🛠️ Feature Engineering:
•We introduced new features such as lagged sales data, rolling averages, and interaction terms between promotions and holidays to enhance the prediction accuracy.
•Key Features Added:

 📅 Temporal Variables: Day, Month, Year, IsWeekend, etc.
 
 ⏳ Lagged Features: Sales values lagged by 1, 7, and 30 days.
 
 📈 Rolling Features: 7 and 30-day rolling means, sums, and standard deviations of sales.
 
 📊 Exponential Moving Averages: For a more responsive trend analysis.

3.🤖 Modeling:
•We experimented with several models, including ARIMA, SARIMAX, and LGBM. The LGBM model outperformed others, providing the most accurate forecasts with its ability to learn complex relationships and trends within the data.

4.📊 Analysis and Results:
•The LGBM model excelled in predicting sales, offering valuable insights into future sales trends, which is crucial for making informed strategic decisions.
•Key Insights:
 📉 Sales Trends: Varied significantly across different store types and were influenced by seasonal factors  like the Christmas season.
•📆 Interaction Terms: Promotions during holidays had a noticeable impact on sales, effectively captured by our model.

5.📊 Visualization and Presentation:
•We used Power BI to create interactive dashboards, enabling a clear and dynamic presentation of our findings and model predictions. The visualizations helped in understanding the temporal sales patterns and the effectiveness of our forecasting model.
